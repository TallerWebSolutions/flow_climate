# Uncommunicative Name

## Introduction

An _Uncommunicative Name_ is a name that doesn't communicate its intent well enough.

Poor names make it hard for the reader to build a mental picture of what's
going on in the code. They can also be mis-interpreted; and they hurt the flow
of reading, because the reader must slow down to interpret the names.
