[Rollbar](https://rollbar.com) is a real-time exception reporting service for Ruby and other languages. The Rollbar service will alert you of problems with your code and help you understand them in a ways never possible before. We love it and we hope you will too.

Rollbar-gem is the SDK for Ruby apps and includes support for apps using Rails, Sinatra, Rack, plain Ruby, and other frameworks.

## Setup Instructions

1. [Sign up for a Rollbar account](https://rollbar.com/signup)
2. Follow the [Getting Started](https://docs.rollbar.com/docs/ruby#section-getting-started) instructions in our [Ruby SDK docs](https://docs.rollbar.com/docs/ruby) to install rollbar-gem and configure it for your platform.

## Usage and Reference

For complete usage instructions and configuration reference, see our [Ruby SDK docs](https://docs.rollbar.com/docs/ruby).

## Compatibility

Version >= 3.0.0 is compatible with Ruby >= 2.0.0.

### Ruby 2.6.0

> WARNING: Ruby 2.6.0 introduced a new bug bug ([#15472 -
Invalid JSON data being sent from Net::HTTP in some cases with Ruby 2.6.0](https://bugs.ruby-lang.org/issues/15472)) that may result in the Rollbar API returning an error when an exception is reported.  (See [rollbar-gem issue #797](https://github.com/rollbar/rollbar-gem/issues/797)).

> UPDATE: This bug is fixed in Ruby 2.6.1, and rollbar-gem has a safe workaround in version >= 2.19.0.
If you need to stay on Ruby 2.6.0 for any reason, make sure you have the latest rollbar-gem.
